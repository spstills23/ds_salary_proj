About RMS
There’s a 1% chance an earthquake will cause $50 billion of insured loss within the next 12 months and a 5% chance that a hurricane will cause $60 billion of insured losses next year. At RMS, we turn risks into real numbers. How? By building simulation models that allow insurers and investors to understand and manage their global risks--from hurricanes, quakes, and wildfires, to cyberattacks, terror attacks, and pandemics. Why? We want to build a more resilient world, and we’re on a mission to help make every risk known.

Insurers, reinsurers, investors, financial institutions, governments, and NGOs trust RMS solutions to better understand and manage catastrophe risks. RMS was founded in 1989 by Stanford scientists who created our first model for California Earthquake. Today, RMS has some 1,300 employees across 13 offices in the US, London, Bermuda, Zurich, India, China, Japan, Singapore, and Australia, and over 1,000 products and models now covering six continents.

RMS helped pioneer the natural catastrophe model market we now lead – and we continue to innovate. In May 2019, we announced RMS Risk Intelligence™ (RI), an open-standard platform for strategic risk management. Through this purpose-built platform, clients can tap into RMS HD models, rich data layers, intuitive applications and APIs that simply integrate into existing enterprise systems to support business decisions across underwriting, risk selection, mitigation, and portfolio management.

We are a profitable, bootstrapped tech startup offering competitive salary + equity packages to top candidates. Our office is in the Innovation Hub in Downtown Gainesville. Our first cofounders met as early hires at the successful fintech startup, Square.

Bridgerock Data is a Data Science first technology company focused on direct to consumer brands (DTC). This ecommerce market is growing fast. Few people know that at $61bn per year, the ecommerce platform, Shopify, sells more online than Walmart, and may soon pass the entire chain.

Shopify, and its competitors, enable creative retail startups to flourish. The most successful of these all hit a major growth painpoint: Brands must advertise to grow, but marketers fear wasting money on ads.

Bridgerock uses Data Science to show which ads are wasting money. We are not an AdTech agency. We audit the AdTech agencies. We solve important, practical, challenging problems. We focus on accuracy. Cutting low impact marketing spend is a big advantage to our clients.

From the classroom to the halls of government, this means finding profoundly different approaches to how we structure, implement and support schooling. We reconceive every aspect of school design, from writing rigorous new curricula to drawing regularly on the advances in technology and business that are transforming every sector except education.

Over the past decade, Success Academies has grown faster than any charter network in the nation, building a vibrant network of 47 elementary, middle and high schools. Our ~16,000 children mostly poor and minority are out-performing students at top city and suburban schools across New York State. Our goals for our second decade are even more ambitious: to grow to 100 schools and to educate 50,000 children across New York City in a uniquely holistic pre-k-12 system, bringing transformational change here and across the country. At 100 schools, we will graduate 3,000 scholars each year who are prepared to enter, persist and graduate from college and eventually to lead in business, government and civic realms.

Scaling schooling excellence as we rapidly grow is an imperative. To further position the organization to do this, Success Academies is prioritizing the continued build out of a scalable, technology enabled model for operating and managing its schools by establishing a School Management Services capability that is intended to deliver an enhanced set of services to better support our network schools. A key pillar of School Management Services is Data & Analytics -- data science, analytics and reporting combined represent a critical function to enable our enterprise to be truly data-driven.

From the classroom to the halls of government, this means finding profoundly different approaches to how we structure, implement and support schooling. We reconceive every aspect of school design, from writing rigorous new curricula to drawing regularly on the advances in technology and business that are transforming every sector except education.

Over the past decade, Success Academies has grown faster than any charter network in the nation, building a vibrant network of 47 elementary, middle and high schools. Our ~16,000 children mostly poor and minority are out-performing students at top city and suburban schools across New York State. Our goals for our second decade are even more ambitious: to grow to 100 schools and to educate 50,000 children across New York City in a uniquely holistic pre-k-12 system, bringing transformational change here and across the country. At 100 schools, we will graduate 3,000 scholars each year who are prepared to enter, persist and graduate from college and eventually to lead in business, government and civic realms.

Scaling schooling excellence as we rapidly grow is an imperative. To further position the organization to do this, Success Academies is prioritizing the continued build out of a scalable, technology enabled model for operating and managing its schools by establishing a School Management Services capability that is intended to deliver an enhanced set of services to better support our network schools. A key pillar of School Management Services is Data & Analytics -- data science, analytics and reporting combined represent a critical function to enable our enterprise to be truly data-driven.

The biggest blocker to delivering ML models in production is no longer the algorithms, but the data (or lack thereof) to train the models. Currently, this has been solved by scaling-out human annotators or labelers and there are a number of managed services that have risen to meet this need. However, for use cases that require specific context (intelligence, legal, cyber, etc.) and/or is based on sensitive or classified data, these solutions are untenable.

Watchful is a disruptive automated annotation platform that puts the power back in the hands of data scientists and subject matter experts to label orders of magnitude more data, in orders of magnitude less time.

We are backed by some of the best investors in tech - Foundation Capital, Quest Venture Partners, FF VC, and Haystack. We are currently hiring engineers and data scientists to join our focused team.
